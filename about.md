My name is Dave Nielsen. I am a Front-End Web Developer, currently working at
[Squava](http://squava.com).

I'm really good at identifying and dismantling a problem, picking it apart, and
rebuilding it to be more functional, efficient, and powerful than ever before.

I am naturally meticulous and detail-oriented.

These skills drive my passion of working on old cars. I gain many lessons and
draw inspiration in this pursuit that inspires my professional approach.

I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Web Design & Development from
[BYU-Idaho](http://www.byui.edu/) in April 2016. I currently live in Salt Lake
City, Utah with my wife and daughter.
