Title: Nintendo 3DS XL Review

I recently upgraded from a Nintendo 3DS to the newer version, the 3DS XL, released on August 19, 2012. This review therefore may be a bit dated but still useful to those who would like to make the upgrade on the cheap.

##Cost

The 3DS currently retails at 169.99, while the XL goes for 199.99. As I will describe in more detail, the XL is an absolute must buy for first time buyers, and definitely worth the upgrade for those already owning existing 3DS. Those who are eBay savvy can find a decent used unit such as mine for about $160. Best Buy also had a sale recently where a new unit could be had for $175. I am now currently in the process of selling my old 3DS on eBay, where they sell for used in good condition for about $120-$130.

##Features

###The New Displays

The main draw of the 3DS XL is its 90% increase in screen size. [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com) aptly described the comparison in screen size between the two: 
>THE 3DS IS LIKE PEERING THROUGH A PEEPHOLE, 
>BUT THE XL IS LIKE STEPPING THROUGH A DOOR

The larger size makes gaming on the 3DS much more immersive and is much more relaxing on the eyes, especially with the 3D slider enabled.

One minor complaint I have with the redesign is the placement of the power/charge LED's on the inside of the unit rather than the side. This can be annoying when playing in the dark, as they are very bright and shine almost directly into your eyes. It is a bit distracting from the otherwise beautiful displays.

The displays have also been giving a bump in their anti-glare capability. Reflectivity on the original 3DS screen was about 12%, whereas with the 3DS XL it has been reduced to just 3%. When gaming in any amount of sunlight the superiority of these new displays is clearly evident.

####Does the bigger screen compromise picture quality?

Some people may have concerns about games being scaled up to that bigger size and how it will affect the picture quality. While the screen resolution stays the same, I didn't have any complaints. Initially, I could see a slight difference as the picture appeared a bit more "pixely" but after playing for a day, I no longer even noticed it.


###Build Quality and Ergonomics

The first thing I noticed after taking the 3DS XL out of the box was the heft it had. It feels solid without feeling heavy. Handling the XL gives a real sense that the build quality is good, and makes the regular 3DS feel a bit cheap in comparison.

As far as gaming comfort, for bigger hands like mine, the bigger size makes a difference. No longer do my hands get cramped after sitting down for a long session of MarioKart 7 or other button-mashing-heavy titles. Initially, the bigger size takes adjustment. I was a bit underwhelmed at first, noticing my hands felt a little uncomfortable, but after trial-and-error using a couple different awkward positions, found a comfortable way to hold it. This experience may differ from person to person, but ultimately it is a more comfortable experience for adult owners. Children's smaller hands may have more difficulty navigating the expanded layout, so keep that in mind if you plan to buy one as a gift for a young one.

One convenient improvement of the XL is the change in location of the stylus from the back to the side of the unit. It makes it *much* more accessible. The stylus itself is also thicker and longer, and no longer has to be retracted to full length. This makes using the stylus much more comfortable and quick. You can pull it out and pop it back in without hardly thinking about it, which makes a very noticeable difference when you can continue to game without losing your focus.

###Battery Life
The battery life in the 3DS XL is noticeably better. Gaming time is increased by about 30-60 minutes, but where the bigger battery shines is when the system is in standby. My old 3DS seemed to die quickly, and I grew into a habit of having it almost constantly plugged into a power source. The XL does give you a bit more flexibility. You can close the lid and set it aside without having to worry about it being dead next time you pick it up, which is really nice from a convenience standpoint.

###Additional Notes
The 3DS XL retains the same cameras and software as the 3DS. If upgrading from a  previous Nintendo DS system, you can use the System Transfer utility to move all of your content and purchases to the new console. The process can be a bit frustrating, as Nintendo restricts you to performing the transfer 5 times total and no more than once in a 7-day period.

##Closing Thoughts
The build quality, the immersive quality of the larger screens, and improved battery life more than justify the extra $30 for a 3DS XL. I would highly recommend buying one right now. The recent slew of games announced at E3 2013 makes this purchase even more compelling. The 3DS XL may not be the king of the mobile gaming market from a hardware standpoint, but given its large library of quality games, the relatively low price tag, and the "fun" experience it provides (which is Nintendo's expertise after all) solidify its standing as the #1 gaming handheld on the market. 

The Nintendo 3DS currently retails for $199.99 and comes with a 4GB SD card. Additional information from [Nintendo.](https://www.nintendo.com/3ds)
