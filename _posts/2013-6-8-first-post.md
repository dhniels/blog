"FIRST!"

Many a spirited YouTuber has declared these words with giddy excitement in order to prove some sort of point that they are the commenting authority on that particular video. Well I am here to say "FIRST!"

Welcome to my blog.

I don't have much of a "mission statement" to declare my objective in writing but I intend to keep my scope broad and hopefully as I attract readers like yourselves, establish a narrow focus and interest set to my writings.

## Let's Talk About Me

My name is Dave Nielsen. I am a student of Web Design at Brigham Young University Idaho, in a little Idaho town called Rexburg. My wife Taylor and I enjoy the outdoors and all it has to offer.

A few of my interests include:

- Camping
- Computers
- Video games
- Politics, or more narrowly, Libertarianism
- Peanut butter sandwiches

### So Why The Blog?

I would like to convey my thoughts and hopefully attract a broad audience of readers. Some of my reasons are selfish (to practice writing) but I hope to write about, well, pretty much everything. Anything and everything I experience in my day to day life. This will most likely include:

- Tech news/reviews
- Gaming news/reviews
- Technical guides
- My daily political research, findings, and musings
- Things I am doing in school (HTML/CSS/design/languages/projects/etc)
- Travel and adventure in general
- â€¦and likely food pics
- (also highly probably that I will post pictures of cats at some point)
